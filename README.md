# Piazza Tracker Extension

## Installation:
- Open Chrome and on the extensions bar click the puzzle and go to **Manage Extensions**.

## Notes:
- *Time tracking pauses when you switch tabs. Can be disabled by commenting out 68-76 in content_script.js*

## Areas for Improvement:
- Enhance the UI design.
- Disable the popup of the extension on non-Piazza pages.
- Decrease amount of API calls for storage.
- Implement a feature to display the total time spent across all classes.
