# Piazza Tracker Extension

## Installation:
- Open Chrome and on the extensions bar click the puzzle and go to **Manage Extensions**.
- Click on **Load Unpacked**.
- Locate and select the extension folder.

## Notes:
- *Time tracking pauses when you switch tabs.*
- *This feature exclusively monitors the duration of TAd classes.*

## Areas for Improvement:
- Enhance the UI design.
- Diminish the visibility of the extension on non-Piazza pages.
- Optimize API calls for storage efficiency.
- Implement a feature to display the total time spent across all classes.
